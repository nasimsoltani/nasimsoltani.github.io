I am a PhD candidate at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, MA. I started my PhD in computer engineering in Fall 2018 under the supervision of Prof. Kaushik Chowdhury. My reasearch is broadly at the intersection of wireless communications and machine learning, and my thesis topic is **"Deep Learning for the Physical Layer: From Signal Classification to Decoding"**.  

## Research Interests 
- **Spectrum Sensing**: Deep learning for signal detection, classification, and spectrum localization.
- **Device authentication**: Deep learning-based methods for device authentication using the physical layer signal properties (RF fingerprinting).
- **Receiver chain design**: Deep learning-based OFDM receivers (WiFi/Cellular) for next-G wireless systems.
