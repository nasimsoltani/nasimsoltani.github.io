I am a PhD candidate at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, MA. I started my PhD in computer engineering in Fall 2018 under the supervision of Prof. [Kaushik Chowdhury](https://genesys-lab.org/team/kaushik-chowdhury). My reasearch is broadly at the intersection of wireless communications and machine learning, and my thesis topic is **"Deep Learning for the Physical Layer: From Signal Classification to Decoding"**.

-------------------------------------------------

## Research Interests 
- **Spectrum Sensing**: Deep learning for signal detection, classification, and spectrum localization.
- **Device authentication**: Deep learning-based methods for device authentication using the physical layer signal properties (RF fingerprinting).
- **Receiver chain design**: Deep learning-based OFDM receivers (WiFi/Cellular) for next-G wireless systems.
