I am a PhD candidate at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Northeastern University, Boston, MA. I started my PhD in fall 2018 under the supervision of Prof. Kaushik Chowdhury, on the topic of wireless systems. My research is specifcally about using deep learning algorithms for the physical layer applications of wireless systems.  

Research Interests 
======
- **Spectrum Sensing**: Deep learning for signal detection, classification, and spectrum localization.
- **Device authentication**: Deep learning-based methods for device authentication using the physical layer signal properties (RF fingerprinting).
- **Receiver chain design**: Deep learning-based OFDM receivers (WiFi/Cellular) for next-G wireless systems.
